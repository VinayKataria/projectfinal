## Streamlit  WebApp

This application explores the functionality of some of Google's <a href="https://google.github.io/mediapipe/" style="text-decoration: none;">**Mediapipe**</a> Machine Learning solutions, viz:

  - Hand Tracking
  - Pose Estimation
  - Face Detection 
  - Face Mesh
    


## Demo

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/vinaykataria/issas/main/streamlitMediapipeOnline.py)


The app was been deployed on Streamlit. You can check it out **[here](https://share.streamlit.io/vinaykataria/issas/main/streamlitMediapipeOnline.py)**.


### Note: Video Sources Disabled On Streamlit Share

There have been a couple of issues running video sources on the online shared app:

1. There is a considerable lag when running the Mediapipe modules on videos with one viewer/user. 
2.  If multiple viewers/users attempt to use video inputs at the same time, the app becomes totally unresponsive and needs to be rebooted.

I suspect that both issues are related but I have been unable to get them fixed. Kindly reach out if you have any ideas/suggestions on how I can go about resolving these issues.
